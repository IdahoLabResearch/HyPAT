Brief explanation of datafiles:

In the folder "datafiles" there are several Excel spreadsheets containing information that is used by the program to function. Furthermore, the program can edit these files.

In the folder "backup_datafiles," there is a copy of each data file appended with "_backup" to provide easy access to working files in case something happens to the ones edited by the program.

OverviewPlotsSaveFileExample.xlsx is also in backup_datafiles. It's an example of the sort of file you can get from the "save file" button in the Overview Plots tab.

material_data and melting_tempK are used primarily in the Overview Plots tab, although they also provide the information used in the Permeation Estimates menu for sample material

persistent_permeation_input_variables is used in the Permeation Plots tab
